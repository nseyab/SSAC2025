## Tackling Action Sparsity with Probability Vectors

A soccer team relies on individual players contributing through specific spatial patterns and tactical roles. One of the primary challenges in analyzing player behavior through spatial data is the inherent sparsity of actions during a match. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a new Probability Vectors of Zonal Actions (PVZA) technique, which models player behavior using a multinomial distribution across spatial zones on the pitch. The goal is to enable comparisons of similar spatial behaviors for clearer interpretation.
